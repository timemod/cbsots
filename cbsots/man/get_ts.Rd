\usage{
get_ts(id, ts_code, refresh = FALSE, raw_cbs_dir = "raw_cbs_data",
  include_meta = TRUE, min_year = NULL, frequencies = NULL, download,
  base_url = NULL, download_all_keys = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{table id}

\item{ts_code}{a \code{ts_code} object. This object can be created
and modified with function \code{\link{edit_ts_code}}, which starts a Shiny
app.}

\item{refresh}{should the data in directory \code{raw_cbs_dir} be refreshed?
If \code{TRUE}, the data are always downloaded from the
CBS website. Otherwise  the data will only be downloaded if the
corresponding files in directory \code{raw_cbs_dir} are missing or not
complete (missing dimension keys). The default is \code{FALSE}.
Note that data may also be downloaded when new keys are selected
in the timeseries coding.}

\item{raw_cbs_dir}{directory where the raw downloaded data are stored.}

\item{include_meta}{include meta data (the default is \code{TRUE})}

\item{min_year}{the minimum year of the returned timeseries. Data
for years before \code{min_year} are disregarded. Specify \code{NULL}
or \code{NA} to not impose a minimum year}

\item{frequencies}{a character string specifying the frequencies of the
returned timeseries. Specify \code{"Y"}, \code{"H"}, \code{"Q"} or \code{"M"} for annual,
semi-annual, quarterly or monthly series, respectively. It is possible to specify a
combination of these characters, e.g. \code{"YQ"} for annual and quarterly series.
Another example: to retrieve annual, quarterly and monthly series simultaneously,
specify \code{"YQM"}. The function returns a list with a component for each
specified frequency.}

\item{download}{This argument overrules argument \code{refresh}. If \code{FALSE},
then data all never downloaded again. You will get an error if the files in
directory \code{raw_cbs_dir} are missing or not
complete (missing dimension keys). If \code{TRUE} then data are always
downloaded.}

\item{base_url}{optionally specify a different server. Useful for third party
data services implementing the same protocol.}

\item{download_all_keys}{This option specifies how to download data. By default,
for each table dimension (excluding the topic) only the selected keys in the
timeseries coding are downloaded.  Although this can significantly reduce
downloading  time, this approach has the disadvantage that it is necessary to
download the data again when a new dimension key is selected in the
timeseries coding. To prevent that, use argument \code{download_all_keys = TRUE},
then all keys are downloaded for each dimension.}
}
\value{
a list with class \code{table_ts}, with the following components
\item{Y}{Annual timeseries (if present)}
\item{H}{Semi-annual timeseries (if present)}
\item{Q}{Quarterly timeseries (if present)}
\item{M}{Monthly timeseries (if present)}
\item{ts_names}{A data frame with an overview of the timeseries names}
\item{meta}{Meta data, only if argument \code{include_meta} is \code{TRUE}}
}
